<h3>Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>

<div>
<p>I do not intend to use many images for my website, 
as I would prefer to use divisions that can be written in HTML. 
I intend to use darker colours for many of my webpages, to make it easier for reading, due to the amount of text that will be displayed on one page.

<h3 class="header">Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
<p>It can be assumed to say that almost anything that you personally didn't create is copyrighted, regardless of whenever it is stated or not. 
Copyright is a law that helps protect your own content and allows the user to chase after anyone who uses their content without their permission to use it. 
To avoid any infringement into copyright, it is either advised to make your own images and similar content or use free and royalty-free websites (such as gettyimages) that do specify that images can be used freely [2][3].
In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a website can remove liability from itself when its ‘users commit copyright infringement so long as the websites take the material down’[1}. 
This means that these websites must be constantly monitored to ensure that their website is legal. This thus puts more stain onto the website and requires constant changes, meaning less development time on another project for one example.
There are a few workarounds for copyright, but it is generally preferred and easier for most people to attempt to create their own content instead of using it from somewhere else. 
Many individuals should be okay with this on-off occasions, but small and large business will need to follow copyright guidelines more carefully, as they will be more prone to copyright infringement.
