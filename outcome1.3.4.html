<p>Trello Board can be found by clicking the image or <a href="https://trello.com/b/xMeWYoi6/website-development" target="_blank">Here</a></p>
<p>I will use my own trello board to help plan what I need to do.
 This will help me visualise how much needs doing so that I can assign my time appropriately. 
 Doing it this way will also help catch out anything I might miss. 
 I will also take notes in Word often to keep reminding myself of various points that will need to be addressed.

<h2>Outcome 1.4</h2>
<h3>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>While Technology and IT is a vast improvement to business and projects, it does not come without it’s fair share of risks. 
For example, using an older laptop or desktop is more likely to crash and encounter problems with than a newer model. 
Because of this, it is more likely to lose vital information or parts of a project [1]. 
Another problem we could encounter is not adjusting for it after the project is finished and/or gone live. 
Many problems relating to code might not appear until the final part is pushed and while it might be easy to fix, leaving this problem late into the design cycle may cause problems for bigger companies [3]. 
Not being clear on what needs doing first within a project or pushing away higher priority tasks can also take it’s toll on the projects workflow or even the deadline [2].
