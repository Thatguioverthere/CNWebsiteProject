<h3>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
</div>
<div class="txtBg">
<p>I would start by searching for what current business use and attempting to acquire those first. 
I would then go and learn the program.
This is how I learnt to make 3D models when I Studied Games Art. 
I would also learn the workflow involved and how industry leaders did it and attempt to replicate that, adjusting it as necessary. 
This could also be applied to how I learned to code.
</p>
</div>
<div class="headerBg header">
<h2 class="center">Outcome 1.6</h2>
<h3>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>
</div>
<div class="txtBg">
<p>Trello has helped me visualise and thus plan accordingly without getting too confused in my notes, which could conflict if I began to use different notes. 
Being able to freely adjust and place my own cards to sort them with ease allows for easy updating in where I am in terms of progress. 
Being able to label these cards also allows for more sorting functionality and thus streamline the workflow even better.
</p>
<p>Using Github made this project feel more complete. 
Allowing to freely update files with a timestamp and with a note as an update log made it feel more professional and made it easy to update frequently.
Github has helped me also to catch anything I might have previously, allowing for even more error checking and fixing.

<h3>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
</div>
<div class="txtBg">
<p>There are seven principles on which the GDPR is built on. These principles are:</p>
</div>
<ul class="txtBg">
    <li class="txtBg">Lawfulness, fairness and transparency</li>
    <li class="txtBg">Purpose limitation</li>
    <li class="txtBg">Data minimisation</li>
    <li class="txtBg">Accuracy</li>
    <li class="txtBg">Storage limitation</li>
    <li class="txtBg">Integrity and confidentiality (security)</li>
    <li class="txtBg">Accountability</li>
</ul>
<div class="txtBg">
<p>[2]. These Principles exist to make sure a consumer knows what is happening with their data and give consent to allow it to be Stored and used by the company,
but cannot be used or sold to other companies. 
The consumer can also consent to have their personal data taken off a companies database.
</p>
<p>This personal data can be anything that can identify a person. 
Most common examples of this are e-mail addresses, passwords and names.[1] 
The GDPR ensures that this information is used lawfully, making larger companies give power of their personal data back to the user.
</p>
<p>The impact of GDPR on digital projects can be still seen today, even since GDPR’s enforcement date back in 2018 [3]. 
Many companies are still in an implementation phase, meaning that they are still having to build a place to be able to store, collect and use consumer data [4]. 
Even non-EU companies must comply with GDPR if they have business within the EU [4]. 
Most of these types of projects also now need an appointed data protection officer or a data controller to ensure the project is fit to run under GDPR [4]. 
</p>
<p>On the Consumer side of GDPR, They must now consent to terms and privacy policy of the company, 
which gives the company permission to store and use the user’s information and gives the company a timestamp of when this agreement was signed as well. 
This leaves an audit trail that can later be followed to show that what they opted into, when they did and how they did [4].
</p>
<p>In summary, GDPR allows the user to keep track of their own information and allow them to control it. 
Companies must comply with this and not use a consumer’s information unlawfully. 
The impact of this means that all infrastructure must be updated and tested to make sure that personal information cannot be used unlawfully and protect against data breaches. 
This makes the project run for longer, but makes sure the company is protected against fines from the EU union.
