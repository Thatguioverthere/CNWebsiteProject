<h1>Outcomes Unit 1: 3.3 & 3.4</h1>
<h2>Outcome 3.3</h2>
<h3>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I would use fewer mediums to go about writing and planning. 
For one example, I could write paragraphs directly into the code and then go back and check it again for spelling and grammar mistakes.
Teamwork would help in being able to split up different parts of the project, helping take off the stress on one person. 
It would also help with design and writing, as multiple people could have different ideas for one point and makes up a more diverse answer.

<h2>Outcome 3.4</h2>
<h3>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>For most of my solutions, before I made the website live, I would simply keep the offline version open and once I made a change, 
I would save the code and then refresh the page to see if the changes had worked, making troubleshooting more a visual problem, making it easier to identify.
For clarification on coding and similar problems, 
I did research into free schools and websites that help with coding to understand fully what the code did and what could have been any potential problems.
