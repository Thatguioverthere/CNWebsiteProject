<h2>About Me</h2>
<br>
<img src="me small.jpg" alt="Picture of Me">
<p>I’m Oliver. I’m 22 years old and from Oldham. That’s it, I’ve never moved anywhere else!
</p>
</div>
<div> 
<p>There are many things I like, but the one I’m most passionate about are games.
Just to name a few of my favourite games:</p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Fire Emblem</li>
    <li>Apex Legends</li>
    <li>Bayonetta</li>
    <li>Borderlands</li>
    <li>Animal Crossing</li>
    <li>Super Smash Bros</li>
    <li>Pokemon</li>
    <li>Dragon Quest</li>
</ul>
<p>and many more!</p>

<p>Games have always been a big part of life. My dream since I was a child was to be a game designer, which would explain why I studied Games design in college and obtained a Bachelors degree (with Honours) in games art. 
Although it doesn't officially say it, I like to specialise in Asset and Background creation.  </p>
<p>I could now make 3D and 2D images and models, but there's so much more to making a game! 
One of these parts is coding. This was a topic I attempted to try my hand in previously, but never managed to keep it going. 
Thankfully, I enrolled onto Code Nation, where I realise I could finally learn to code and thus be able to make my own game and have a new skill to add to my repertoire.</p>
<p>My experience with coding is very positive. Prior to the course, looking at code was like looking at a foreign language.
 Now, I am able to piece together what code does what and how to build it up myself using this knowledge. In time, I can only get better and better.</p>
