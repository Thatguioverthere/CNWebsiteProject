<h1>Outcomes Unit 1: 3.1 & 3.2</h1>
<h2>Outcome 3.1</h2>
<h3>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency </h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>While I can see the benefit of having a team for this project, I personally preferred being able to design and go through everything myself. 
It allowed me to double-check my own work and troubleshoot my own problems, which I could then learn and avoid making the same mistake in the future.
I could improve the efficiency further by fully finishing one page and then simply repurpose the code and make changes to the text where needed. 
However, if I wanted the pages to look different, I would have to change the CSS for each page and assign everything a new class and element. 
While this would change the overall look of my website, I personally prefer everything staying to a similar style to keep consistency.

<h2>Outcome 3.2</h2>
<h3>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I found one way of improving my own efficiency was to tackle different aspects of the website in sections. 
For example, I did all of the content that was going to be on the website first, then worked on the HTML and then finally worked on the CSS. 
I did HTML for every page firstly, so that I could assign classes for elements of the website at multiple points.
The productivity could have been improved for this project, as I could've started the coding side much easier or even develop a plan for the website, to help me keep to a consistent design.
