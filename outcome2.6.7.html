<h3>Describing access issues that need taking into account</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are multiple access issues that someone could face when using a website. 
We can use text to speech (TTS) to turn what it is written into audio. 
However, this would not work on images until the alt element has been added to image, allowing the image to be instead described in TTS to the user. 
Another access issue is someone with slow internet that will not be able to load images or in some cases the webpage properly. 
For cases like this, it might be better for only the HTML side of the webpage to load and leave the CSS, so that they are able to still read the webpage.

<h2>Outcome 1.7</h2>
<h3>Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>For images, the more preferred types are .jpeg, .png and .gifs. 
JPEGs and PNG are both able to be compressed and changed without losing too much quality. 
GIFs are exempt from this, as they are moving images or a video, but use less data than using a video player or similar.
For coding, Python and JavaScript are more recognised to be the leading languages for coding and programming. 
HTML and CSS are also seen as the ‘go to’ for designing websites.
