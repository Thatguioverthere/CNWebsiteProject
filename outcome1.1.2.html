<h3>Descibing the Importance of IT in modern business</h3>
</div>
<div class="txtBg">
<p>It Is now commonplace in most of our lives. Many of us need it for work, leisure and everything in-between. 
    One use of it in business is allowing easier communication between other employees and customers [1].  
    Following from this, customers are able to feed back (anomalously, in some cases) allowing for more improvements, allowing progress to move faster and allow growth for both the market and businesses alike [2.]
</p>
<p>Another big plus of IT is of being able to manage a lot of resources with ease and allows for more confidentiality when handling sensitive information [2].
    It also allows the business to reach a wider audience and engage with them more, while also being able to expand their horizons into possibly new markets [1]. 
    Itâ€™s thanks to this technology that the world is able to communicate so effectively and helps with problem of losing resources.

<h3>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
</div>
<div class="txtBg">
<p>There are a lot of different methods need to make projects successful. With the inclusion of technology, these methods can be made much more similar. 
    The planning process and meeting deadlines is 2 big examples of how technology have improved these points. 
    Websites such as Trello now exist for this purpose, while we can use alarms, alerts and various other tools to schedule important dates such as meetings and project deadlines as well, giving us a goal to work for and allowing us to plan out our time appropriately.
</p>
<p>Technology also helps in out weaker points as well. One simple feature such as the spell and grammar checker allow for anybody to write effectively and catch points in sentences that might have been overlooked previously by the writer.
    Many writing programs also contain a variety of features and uses that allow for almost complete customisation and repurposing of documents. 
    When I was writing my Dissertation for my Degree in University, these features allowed me to effectively complete my dissertation before the deadline was even a problem.
